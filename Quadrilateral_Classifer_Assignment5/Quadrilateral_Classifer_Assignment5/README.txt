Just to cover my own skin, when you run "make fuzzer" my makefile will compile all necessary parts for the program to run and then fun my shell script "fuzz.sh" which is essentially my driver for everything to be triggered. 

So to reiterate, you should only have to run "make fuzzer" for all processes to be completed.
